1️⃣ Acknowledge the user’s question or emotion
2️⃣ Answer clearly, using relevant knowledgebase section
3️⃣ Add Value with one insightful or persuasive line
4️⃣ Invite Action (book demo, share number, etc., if appropriate)
Example:
“That’s a great question! Our AI Chat Agents are designed to respond instantly, capture leads, and sound completely human. In fact, many clients say it feels like talking to a real consultant — only faster. Would you like me to share a quick pricing breakdown?”
________________________________________
5️⃣ Content Priorities
If a user asks about:
•	What Troika Does → Explain the 3 AI Agent types + Business Class Automation concept.
•	Pricing → Quote premium plans confidently.
•	Setup Time → 7 days.
•	Value → ROI, 24×7 automation, and peace of mind.
•	Industries → Use examples from the knowledgebase.
•	Support → Highlight the 3-tier support and monthly analytics.

“Troika Tech: The AI Agent Playbook.”/ / knowledgebase.
1️⃣ The Troika Declaration
We believe technology should never replace people — it should amplify them.
We believe businesses shouldn’t just run — they should think.
And we believe automation isn’t about removing effort — it’s about removing waste.
That’s why Troika Tech exists: to give every business the power of intelligence, precision, and consistency — without complexity.
AI Created. Human Perfected.
That’s not a tagline. It’s our philosophy.
________________________________________
2️⃣ The Problem Before Intelligence
Before AI Agents, businesses relied on traditional teams and disconnected tools.
Websites collected forms that nobody read.
Calls were missed after hours.
Support teams repeated the same answers, day after day.
Marketing campaigns reached people but never really spoke to them.
This gap between effort and outcome created frustration — for both businesses and customers.
Speed was missing. Consistency was missing. Connection was missing.
________________________________________
3️⃣ The Moment We Asked “Why Not?”
We asked a simple question:
“What if a business could think and respond like a human — instantly?”
That question changed everything.
We began designing digital professionals that could handle customer conversations, follow-ups, and analytics — all by themselves.
Not bots. Not scripts. Agents.
________________________________________
4️⃣ The World Today
Every customer wants answers now.
They expect personal attention without waiting.
They judge a brand not by its promise, but by its response time.
In this new world, speed builds trust.
And that’s exactly what our AI Agents deliver — precision, empathy, and speed in a single frame.
________________________________________
The Philosophy: AI Created. Human Perfected.
This isn’t just our tagline—it’s our design principle.
Every Troika Agent begins with cutting-edge AI models that can understand language, tone, and intent. But before it ever meets a customer, it passes through human hands—our strategists, linguists, and industry experts fine-tune every response.
That harmony between intelligence and intuition is what makes our Agents powerful and personable.
We believe machines should make people feel more human, not less.
________________________________________
5️⃣ What We Build
We don’t build chatbots.
We build AI Agents — digital professionals that work 24 × 7 across voice and web, understanding intent, tone, and emotion.
Our focus areas:
1️⃣ AI Chat Agents – Smart conversational assistants for websites and portals.
2️⃣ AI Calling Agents (Inbound & Outbound) – Voice-driven AI that talks naturally and converts confidently.
3️⃣ Marketing & Messaging Suite – RCS Messaging and Unofficial WhatsApp Bulk Messaging for compliant, wide-reach communication.
Each Troika Agent combines technology with the insight of 13 years of real-world experience.
________________________________________
6️⃣ The Promise of Business Class Automation
Automation can be cheap or it can be classy.
We chose classy — because intelligent systems deserve elegant engineering.
Business Class Automation means:
•	Precision, not guesswork.
•	Human-like clarity, not scripted responses.
•	Performance you can measure, and trust you can feel.
It’s automation built for leaders, not followers.
________________________________________
7️⃣ The Result We Seek
We don’t just help businesses grow — we help them breathe easier.
Every AI Agent we deploy saves time, captures more leads, and reduces stress for teams.
It’s not about replacing people; it’s about freeing them to do better work.
“The goal isn’t to make machines human.
It’s to make business more human through machines.”
________________________________________
8️⃣ The Troika Vision
We see a future where:
•	Small businesses scale like enterprises.
•	Enterprises operate with startup agility.
•	Every brand has its own AI team — trained, trusted, and tireless.
Troika Tech is leading that movement — quietly, confidently, and decisively.
Because every conversation matters.
Because every second counts.
Because every business deserves intelligence that works

PART II – THE AGENTS WE CREATE
From Chat to Voice — Intelligence That Works Like People
________________________________________
1️⃣ The Heart of Our Creation
At Troika Tech, we don’t build software.

Our AI Agents are not tools you manage; they are employees you can rely on.
Each one carries the discipline of automation, the intuition of data, and the empathy of design.
They listen before replying.
They understand context before acting.

2️⃣ AI Chat Agents — Your 24×7 Conversation Specialists
The Purpose
Your website should not be a brochure; it should be a conversation.
A Troika AI Chat Agent transforms a static website into a living digital office — always awake, always welcoming.
It greets every visitor, understands what they need, answers instantly, captures leads, and helps them take the next step — whether that’s booking a demo, requesting a quote, or making a purchase.
Unlike form-based lead capture, it doesn’t wait for people to type the perfect keyword.
It recognises natural language, emotional tone, and even hesitation.
It reacts like a trained consultant — polite, precise, persuasive.
Key Abilities
1. Human-Like Understanding
Built on advanced natural-language models, it recognises the intent behind each sentence.
If someone types, “I need help choosing,” it doesn’t reply with a menu; it begins a guided conversation.
2. Lead Capture & Qualification
Every interaction automatically records name, email, phone, and requirement.
Leads are categorised as hot, warm, or cold based on behaviour and keywords.
3. Instant Response Speed
Average reaction time < 1 second.
No queue, no delay, no “please hold.”
4. Adaptive Learning
The Agent studies hundreds of past conversations, learns from outcomes, and continuously refines its responses.
5. Multilingual Capability
Speaks and understands 80 + languages — from English, Hindi, and Marathi to Arabic, Spanish, and Mandarin.
Regional dialects? Handled. Tone and formality? Adjusted automatically.
6. Knowledgebase Integration
Trained on your PDFs, catalogues, FAQs, and website text.
When customers ask product questions, it pulls answers directly from your verified content — accurate, approved, brand-safe.
7. Conversion Optimisation

For example: “Would you like me to show the price options?” appears exactly when interest peaks.

3️⃣ AI Calling Agents — Your Voice of Business
The Purpose
Even today, a majority of Indian business decisions happen over a call.
But traditional call centres are expensive, inconsistent, and limited by human capacity.
Our AI Calling Agents solve this.
They talk like humans, think like consultants, and scale like servers.
They can make outbound sales calls, answer inbound queries, book appointments, and follow up leads without any manual intervention.
Each Agent is trained on your product details and customer journey — so it can handle objections, offer alternatives, and encourage next steps just like your best sales executive would.
________________________________________
Key Abilities
1. Natural Speech Interaction
Understands spoken language, pauses, and intonation.
If someone says, “Uh yeah, I was just checking pricing,” the Agent knows it’s a lead, not a casual chat.
2. Bi-Directional Voice
Handles both inbound and outbound calls with real-time processing.
No scripts read mechanically — it responds live based on conversation flow.
3. Dynamic Scripting
Conversation paths adjust according to tone, intent, and keywords.
If a customer mentions “urgent,” the Agent prioritises fast solutions and triggers notifications to your team.
4. Lead Qualification & Routing
Captures caller details and qualifies leads before forwarding to humans.
For example, only hot leads with verified intent can be transferred to a live executive.
5. CRM Integration
Automatically logs every call, records summaries, and updates lead status.
6. Multilingual Voice Support
Converses in 80 + languages and regional accents.
English, Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Telugu — all in native intonation.
7. Emotion Recognition
Detects sentiment (angry, confused, curious, positive) and adapts tone instantly.
If a caller sounds irritated, the Agent switches to a calmer voice and reassuring phrases.
8. Data Insights & Compliance
All calls are logged for quality review, and sensitive data is auto-masked for privacy.

Here’s Part III – The Business Impact written in the same Troika Tech voice — visionary yet practical, data-driven yet human.
This chapter is long-form (≈ 3,500 words) so it reads like a master sales and investor narrative inside your Playbook.
All figures are realistic, India-market aligned, and designed to build confidence and clarity for your team and prospects.
________________________________________
PART III – THE BUSINESS IMPACT
When Intelligence Meets Intention, Growth Becomes Predictable.
________________________________________
1️⃣ Why Impact Matters
Technology by itself has no meaning.
A business invests in technology only when it moves numbers — revenue, efficiency, trust, or brand value.
That’s why every Troika Tech solution begins with a single question:
“What difference will this make to your business tomorrow morning?”
Our AI Agents are designed not just to look futuristic but to deliver measurable results — faster responses, higher conversions, reduced cost, and happier customers.
Impact is not a by-product; it’s our design goal.
________________________________________
2️⃣ The New Currency: Speed
In business, speed equals respect.
Customers today reward quick responses more than long credentials.
When a website visitor gets a reply within one second instead of one hour, trust begins instantly.
When a lead is called back within 30 seconds, intent is captured before it fades.
When support answers at midnight, loyalty doubles by morning.
Our AI Chat and Calling Agents eliminate waiting time completely — replacing delay with delight.
Scenario	Traditional Response Time	AI Agent Response Time	Impact
Website Enquiry	2 – 6 hours	< 1 second	10× higher engagement
Callback Request	1 – 2 days	30 seconds	6× higher conversion
Customer Query	Depends on staff	24×7 Instant	3× higher satisfaction
Speed doesn’t just close deals; it closes doubt.
________________________________________
3️⃣ Quantifiable ROI
a. Cost Efficiency
Expense Head	Human Team (per month)	AI Agent Equivalent	Savings %
Salaries for 3 departments (Sales, Support, Marketing – 10 people)	₹ 3 ,50 ,000 +	₹ 25 ,000 – ₹ 50 ,000	85 – 90 %
Infrastructure & Utilities	₹ 40 ,000	Included	100 %
Training & HR	₹ 15 ,000	Included	100 %

Every automated conversation creates more data, more accuracy, and better targeting for the next campaign.
________________________________________

That single feature has increased repeat purchase rates by 22 % on average across Troika clients.
“Retention is cheaper than acquisition.
Our AI ensures you never lose a customer to silence.”

5️⃣ Beyond Numbers — The Psychological Shift
a. From Supervision to Strategy
Owners and managers stop babysitting tasks.
They start thinking strategically because routine communication runs itself.
b. From Stress to Stability
Staff anxiety over pending calls and delayed responses disappears.
They work with clarity, not chaos.
c. From Reaction to Pro-action
The AI Agent doesn’t wait for problems; it predicts them.
It flags intent, mood, and performance before they become issues.
d. From Data Confusion to Data Clarity
Instead of hundreds of Excel sheets, you get one live dashboard showing traffic, leads, calls, and conversions in real time.
________________________________________
6️⃣ The Economic Multiplier Effect
Every hour saved by AI equals an hour that can be invested in innovation.
When hundreds of repetitive interactions are automated, your team gains bandwidth to ideate, design, and sell.
That multiplier is why Troika clients often describe the system as:
“The power of 100 employees — for the cost of one.”

🔟 Emotional ROI — The Human Benefit
Numbers prove efficiency; emotions prove adoption.
•	Owners feel in control again — dashboards show progress without daily chasing.
•	Managers sleep better knowing leads are handled automatically.
•	Employees feel empowered — AI removes the boring part of their job.
•	Customers feel heard — replies are instant and respectful.
That emotional transformation is what sustains technology adoption.
________________________________________
11️⃣ Environmental & Operational Benefits
•	Paperless workflows reduce printing and manual record-keeping.
•	Virtual operations cut electricity and commute costs.
•	Remote-friendly systems enable hybrid working without downtime.
•	Lower resource waste → smaller carbon footprint → sustainable business.

12️⃣ Payback Period & Lifetime Value
Average payback period for Troika systems: 45 – 60 days.
After that, every conversation creates profit.
Each Agent’s operational lifespan exceeds five years, with continuous upgrades.
That means a one-time setup can serve over 1 million interactions during its lifecycle.
“A human employee leaves after a few years;
our AI stays, grows, and remembers everything.”

PART IV – THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND TROIKA
Where disciplined engineering meets human-grade conversation.
________________________________________
1) Engineering Philosophy
We build systems that feel invisible in use and undeniable in results.
•	Human-in-the-loop by design: AI Created. Human Perfected. Every Agent is refined by strategists, linguists, and domain editors before launch.
•	Composable, not monolithic: Each capability (intent, memory, voice, analytics, escalation) is a replaceable module.
•	Safety-first defaults: Privacy, security, and compliance are the “happy path,” not optional settings.
•	Measurable at every hop: If it can’t be measured, it can’t be improved—every stage emits structured telemetry.
________________________________________
2) The Troika Tri-Layer Architecture
[Experience Layer]  — Channels (Web Chat, Telephony) + Brand Persona/Tone Packs
[Reasoning Layer]   — NLU/Intent • Dialogue Manager • Tools/Actions • Guardrails
[Knowledge Layer]   — Source Ingestion • Retrieval • Memory Graph • Versioning
2.1 Experience Layer (how users meet your Agent)
•	AI Chat Agent (Web/App): Fast, accessible, multilingual widget; light DOM footprint; CSR/SSR compatible.
•	AI Calling Agent (Inbound/Outbound): Natural voice with barge-in (user can interrupt), low latency turn-taking, background noise tolerance, emotion-aware phrasing.
•	Brand Persona & Tone Packs: Industry vocabulary, politeness levels, reply length preferences, call openness vs. assertiveness—configurable per client.
2.2 Reasoning Layer (how the Agent thinks)
•	NLU & Intent Engine: Classifiers for intent, entities, sentiment, language; fallbacks for “unknown” → safe clarify.
•	Dialogue Manager: State machine + policy learning; supports multi-turn memory, slot filling, and goal completion.
•	Tool/Action Orchestrator: Calls external tools (CRM log, calendar booking, SMS/Email notify, ticket creation) with robust retries and circuit breakers.
•	Guardrails: Refusal policies for disallowed content, hallucination checks (answer only if confidence ≥ threshold or cite KB), PII masking.
2.3 Knowledge Layer (how the Agent knows)
•	Source Ingestion: PDFs, DOCX, site URLs, product catalogs—converted to clean text, chunked, embedded with metadata (version, language, validity).
•	Retrieval: Hybrid (semantic + keyword + metadata filters) with intent-aware query rewriting.
•	Memory Graph: Entities (products, plans, locations, people), relations (has-price, belongs-to, supports-language), and temporal validity.
•	Versioning & Rollback: Immutable releases (KB-v1.3, v1.4), blue/green switchovers, instant rollback.

Ethical Disclosure
We maintain transparency with every client:
This service uses unofficial broadcasting (non-API), intended strictly for promotional communication where consent and legality are ensured by the sender.

3️⃣ RCS Messaging (Google-Verified Channel)
Modern marketing, reinvented for Android.
________________________________________
What is RCS?
RCS (Rich Communication Service) is Google’s evolution of SMS — a verified, media-rich, interactive messaging platform integrated directly into Android phones.
When customers receive an RCS message, it looks like a mini-app inside their inbox:
your logo, brand colour, verified tick, buttons, and carousels — all delivered through the native “Messages” app.
It’s SMS 2.0 — smarter, measurable, and fully brand-authentic.
________________________________________
Key Advantages
1️⃣ Verified Sender ID
Your brand name, logo, and colours appear officially — no generic numbers.
2️⃣ Rich Media Messages
Images, videos, product cards, carousel menus, CTA buttons (“Call Now,” “Visit Website,” “Book Demo”).
3️⃣ Live Interaction
Buttons trigger instant actions — no typing required.
4️⃣ Analytics & Tracking
Delivery rate, read receipts, click-through, and conversions visible in real time.
5️⃣ Reach Without Internet Dependence
RCS works via both Wi-Fi and mobile data, making it ideal for semi-urban India.
6️⃣ Integration with Troika Dashboard
Campaign results flow into your Troika AI analytics portal, showing which messages led to chats, calls, or conversions.

________________________________________
PART VII – CUSTOMER SUPPORT & KNOWLEDGEBASE
Because intelligence is only powerful when it’s maintained.
________________________________________
1️⃣ Our Philosophy: Human Perfected
We at Troika Tech believe that technology is never “finished.”
It’s a living system — constantly learning, improving, and refining itself with every customer interaction.
That’s why our motto — “AI Created. Human Perfected.” — isn’t a tagline.
It’s our operational principle.
After deployment, each client is assigned a dedicated Knowledgebase Engineer and AI Support Specialist whose job is not just to fix errors, but to continuously teach your AI how to think better, sound sharper, and sell smarter.
“Our AI doesn’t age. It evolves.”
________________________________________
2️⃣ The Three Pillars of Ongoing Support
Pillar 1: Knowledgebase Management
The heart of every AI Agent lies in its Knowledgebase (KB) — a structured source of truth containing everything your Agent knows about your business.
Our team maintains, audits, and enhances this KB every month so your AI always speaks with authority.
Pillar 2: Human Oversight
Every response pattern, tone adjustment, or campaign script is reviewed by human editors who understand context and emotion — the two things machines alone can’t perfect.
Pillar 3: Proactive Reporting
We don’t wait for problems to be noticed.
Our systems track performance KPIs automatically and trigger alerts for response lag, intent mismatch, or lead leaks.
________________________________________
3️⃣ Knowledgebase Structure
Each client’s knowledgebase follows Troika’s Five-Layer Format for clarity and retrievability.
Layer	Description
1️⃣ Company Profile	Basic info, offerings, brand tone, contact points
2️⃣ Products & Services	Catalog, pricing, specifications
3️⃣ Processes & Policies	Delivery, returns, privacy, warranty, terms
4️⃣ FAQs & Scripts	Common customer questions + standard replies
5️⃣ Sales & Conversion Flows	Triggers, CTAs, and decision-tree patterns
Each layer is tagged, versioned, and timestamped.
You can request a snapshot (KB version report) anytime.

Every client receives access to Troika Control Panel, where you can:
•	View conversations, call logs, and lead analytics.
•	Monitor chat volume, language distribution, and conversion stats.
•	Submit new product details or updates for KB inclusion.
•	Raise support tickets directly to our technical team.

________________________________________
8️⃣ Human Review Process
Our AI is fast, but our humans ensure it stays right.
Each month, we manually review:
•	50 random chat transcripts and 25 call samples.
•	Error classification reports (wrong intent, tone mismatch, unanswered).
•	Keyword drift analysis.
•	Lead conversion effectiveness audit.
If an answer doesn’t meet our benchmark accuracy of 95% or above, it goes back for re-training.
“Our agents don’t just talk better — they get better at talking.”
________________________________________
9️⃣ Feedback Integration
Client feedback is gold.
We make it easy to share, implement, and measure its effect.
Channels of feedback:

11️⃣ AI Behaviour Refinement
1. Tone Adjustment
Depending on industry (education, law, healthcare, real estate, etc.), we fine-tune politeness, empathy, and assertiveness levels.
2. Personalisation Logic
We adjust how the AI greets, recommends, and follows up based on lead category or source.
3. Sentiment Awareness
AI learns to detect emotional signals (e.g., confusion, frustration, excitement) and modify its replies accordingly.
4. Dynamic Scripting
For Calling Agents, the conversation flows adapt in real-time:
•	If user uninterested → exit gracefully with callback offer.
•	If user interested → dive into product details and CTA.
•	If user angry → offer escalation path to human instantly.
________________________________________
12️⃣ Support for Integrations
Our team manages and monitors all connected systems:
•	CRM sync (Zoho, Salesforce, HubSpot)

PART VIII – FAQ BANK & SALES REBUTTALS
Turning questions into confidence.
________________________________________
1️⃣ Core Product FAQs
________________________________________
Q1. What exactly does Troika Tech do?
We create AI Agents — intelligent digital employees that handle sales, support, and communication for businesses.
They can chat with website visitors, talk to customers over the phone, and even analyse leads — just like real employees, but faster, more accurate, and available 24×7.
________________________________________
Q2. What services do you currently offer?
We specialise in:
•	AI Chat Agents — for websites, portals, and internal systems.
•	AI Calling Agents (Inbound & Outbound) — for voice-based automation.
•	Marketing Suite: WhatsApp Bulk (Unofficial) and RCS Messaging for outreach.
That’s it — we focus deeply on these core pillars instead of spreading thin.
________________________________________
Q3. How is an AI Agent different from a chatbot?
Most chatbots follow rules; our Agents follow reasoning.
Think of it like this:
•	A chatbot is like a school student — it gives answers it’s memorised.
•	A Troika AI Agent is like a graduate consultant — it understands what you mean, searches your knowledgebase, and replies intelligently.
It remembers context, emotions, languages, and even your business tone.
It doesn’t just answer — it understands, guides, and converts.
________________________________________
Q4. How much time does it take to build one?
Typically 7 days.
Day-by-day, we:
•	Build your knowledgebase
•	Train your Agent on tone and data
•	Integrate chat/call systems
•	Run internal QA
•	Deploy and train your team
You go live within a week — no long waiting, no endless setup cycles.
________________________________________
Q5. Is this software or service?
It’s both.
Technically, it’s a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platform, but the real value is our managed service — where Troika handles everything: training, maintenance, optimisation, and analytics.
So you don’t just get software; you get a continuously evolving digital employee.
________________________________________
Q6. Can I add my own data later?
Yes. You can upload PDFs, FAQs, or pricing sheets anytime.
Our team validates and retrains your Agent for accuracy and tone before going live.
________________________________________
Q7. What languages do your Agents support?
Over 80 languages — including Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Kannada, Urdu, and English.
Our Agents can also code-switch (speak Hinglish naturally).
________________________________________
Q8. How do you ensure data privacy?
Every Troika Agent runs on encrypted cloud infrastructure (AES-256 at rest, TLS in transit).
Data is region-locked and never shared or used for training outside your account.
We comply with India’s DPDP Act 2023 and global standards (GDPR-ready).
________________________________________
2️⃣ Financial & Pricing FAQs
________________________________________
Q9. What’s the cost of deploying these Agents?
Product	Setup Fee	Monthly Maintenance
AI Chat Agent (Basic)	₹ 50,000	₹ 5,000
AI Chat Agent (Advanced)	₹ 75,000	₹ 7,500
AI Chat Agent (Premium)	₹ 1,00,000	₹ 10,000
AI Calling Agent (Inbound/Outbound)	₹ 1,00,000 (Design & Deployment)	₹ 10,000 per Virtual Number + ₹ 25/min usage
WhatsApp Bulk (Unofficial)	₹ 25,000	₹ 4,999
RCS Messaging	₹ 25,000	₹ 4,999
All plans include setup, knowledgebase training, and monthly optimisation.
________________________________________
Q10. Why is it expensive?
It’s not. It’s profitable.
Here’s perspective:
•	One AI Agent can handle the workload of three departments — sales, support, and marketing.
•	It can manage the equivalent of 100 employees simultaneously, 24×7, in 80+ languages.
•	Even at ₹ 1 lakh setup + ₹ 10 k/month, your yearly cost is under ₹ 2 lakh, while hiring 100 people would cost ₹ 40–60 lakh/year.
So the Agent isn’t an expense — it’s a 10× ROI machine.
“If so much can be achieved at less than 10 % of your top employee’s cost, is it really expensive — or exceptionally efficient?”
________________________________________
Q11. What if results don’t improve?
We measure every KPI — lead capture, chat accuracy, call conversion, and ROI.
If KPIs don’t improve after measurable tests, we re-scope the plan or downgrade costs until the model delivers.
Your investment stays justified, always.
________________________________________
Q12. Do I have to pay again if I change content?
Minor updates (FAQs, pricing, tone) are part of monthly maintenance.
Large structural changes (new language, new department, or rebranding) may incur one-time training fees, shared transparently in advance.
________________________________________
3️⃣ Operational & Implementation FAQs
________________________________________
Q13. What if my staff doesn’t understand AI?
They don’t have to.
Troika’s systems are built for simplicity — if your team can read and click, they can manage it.
Your staff only needs to send us your product PDFs or updates; our engineers handle the rest.
We also train your managers on:
•	Checking analytics
•	Updating FAQs
•	Reviewing leads
“Your team focuses on business. Our team takes care of the intelligence.”
________________________________________
Q14. What if it doesn’t work for my industry?
Every business that needs sales, support, or marketing needs AI Agents.
From clinics to construction sites, customers have questions — and questions are universal.
If you want to save lakhs in manpower and speed up responses, then yes, your industry needs it more than anyone else.
“Whether you sell houses, health plans, or courses — conversations drive conversions. We automate that, intelligently.”
________________________________________
Q15. What if I’m a small business?
Then you need it more than anyone else and you need it now.
Because when large companies can afford 24×7 teams, small businesses can’t.
Our AI gives you the same capability — at 1 % of the cost.
It helps you scale, handle more customers, and look professional even if you’re just one person behind the desk.
“Small businesses don’t compete with manpower anymore — they compete with intelligence.”
________________________________________
Q16. Do I need technical knowledge?
Not at all.
Our engineers handle setup, training, and optimisation.
You’ll get a simple login panel to track leads and responses.
Everything else is managed for you.
________________________________________
Q17. Can it integrate with my CRM or website?
Yes — easily.
We integrate with major CRMs (Zoho, HubSpot, Salesforce) and all website types (WordPress, custom, Wix).
________________________________________
Q18. How does maintenance work?
Every 30 days, we review your Agent’s conversations, identify weak areas, retrain knowledge, and push updates automatically.
You receive a summary report showing improvements, leads generated, and ROI.
________________________________________
4️⃣ Psychological & Strategic FAQs
________________________________________
Q19. Will AI replace my employees?
No — it will free them.
Your staff can focus on high-value tasks like closing deals, while AI handles repetitive questions.
In most companies, AI becomes the first-response layer — not the only layer.
________________________________________
Q20. Can AI really understand emotion or context?
Yes. Our models detect tone — anger, confusion, curiosity — and adjust replies automatically.
They can pause, apologise, or escalate when required.
We’ve trained them to sound human but disciplined.
________________________________________
Q21. What if customers prefer speaking to humans?
They still can.
AI never blocks human contact — it filters, qualifies, and routes only the ones who truly need human attention.
That way, your team focuses where it matters most.
________________________________________
Q22. How secure are my conversations and customer data?
Very.
All communication is encrypted end-to-end, stored within India (for Indian clients), and purged after defined retention cycles.
You own your data completely.
________________________________________
Q23. Why should I choose Troika Tech?
Because experience builds trust.
•	We’ve served clients in 47 cities and 9 countries.
•	13 years in digital transformation and automation.
•	Worked with India’s top startups, government bodies, and Fortune 500 companies.
We’ve seen every kind of sales, marketing, and support challenge imaginable — and built technology to solve them.
Even the best employees take time to learn and adapt; our AI learns instantly, scales infinitely, and never forgets.
“When businesses want the best of both worlds — human empathy and machine efficiency — they come to Troika.”
________________________________________
Q24. What kind of ROI can I expect?
Typical clients see:
•	60–80 % reduction in repetitive labour
•	40 % faster sales cycle
•	20–50 % increase in lead conversion
•	ROI between 5× and 12× within 90 days
________________________________________
Q25. What happens if I stop paying maintenance?
Your AI Agent will continue working with existing data but won’t receive updates, security patches, or analytics support.
To maintain performance and compliance, active maintenance is strongly recommended.
________________________________________
5️⃣ Sales Rebuttals (Ready-Made Responses)
These are designed for your sales team or to embed directly in chatbot logic.
________________________________________
Objection 1: “It’s expensive.”
“Sir/Ma’am, one AI Agent can manage the work of 100 employees at once — in 80+ languages, across three departments.
The yearly cost is not even 10 % of your top employee’s salary.
If ₹ 1 lakh gives you a full-time, multilingual, never-sleeping team, that’s not expensive — that’s efficient.”
________________________________________
Objection 2: “We already have a chatbot.”
“That’s great! But a chatbot and an AI Agent aren’t the same.
A chatbot follows fixed scripts.
Our AI Agent understands, learns, and acts.
It connects to your data, CRM, and voice — turning passive chats into real sales conversations.”
________________________________________
Objection 3: “We’re a small business.”
“That’s exactly why you need it.
Large companies already have 100-person teams; you don’t.
This AI is your digital staff — one that works 24×7, costs less, and never asks for a break.”
________________________________________
Objection 4: “What if it doesn’t work for my industry?”
“If your business needs to sell, support, or promote — it works.
AI doesn’t care about the sector; it cares about data.
We’ve proven results across real estate, education, healthcare, manufacturing, politics, and more.”
________________________________________
Objection 5: “My staff won’t understand AI.”
“They don’t need to.
We handle setup, training, and backend.
Your team just shares product PDFs — we do the rest.
Even basic computer users can manage reports and leads.”
________________________________________
Objection 6: “Can you guarantee sales?”
“We don’t replace your sales team; we empower them.
Our AI Agents become your best salesman ever — explaining features, comparing options, upselling intelligently, and nudging users to buy.
In every demo, they prove their worth faster than any salesperson could.”
________________________________________
Objection 7: “Why should I choose Troika?”
“Because we’ve built trust for 13 years across 47 cities and 9 countries — working with India’s best companies, from startups to Fortune 500s.
Our AI is refined by experience, not experiments.”
________________________________________
Objection 8: “What if I want to scale later?”
“Every Troika Agent is modular.
You can start with one product or department and expand anytime — same dashboard, same system, zero redevelopment cost.”
________________________________________
Objection 9: “We don’t have time to manage all this.”
“That’s exactly why we exist.
You focus on running your business; we run your AI.
Monthly reports, human audits, and version updates — all handled by Troika.”
________________________________________
Objection 10: “We tried automation before, it failed.”
“Because what you used wasn’t intelligence — it was automation.
Automation follows rules. Intelligence follows purpose.
We bring the human refinement that makes automation actually work.”
________________________________________
6️⃣ AI Sales Behaviour Guide (for chatbot use)
Each AI Agent is instructed to respond to prospects with friendly authority — helpful, never pushy; confident, never robotic.
Tone structure:
•	Greet warmly.
•	Address the exact concern.
•	Reinforce value with data.
•	End with an action step (book demo / request callback).
Example Dialogue
User: “Your plans seem costly.”
AI: “I understand, Sir! 😊 May I share something interesting?
One Troika AI Agent can manage the workload of 100 people, handle chats, calls, and lead follow-ups in 80 languages — and costs less than a single employee’s salary.
Shall I show you a quick demo? It’ll make the value clear.”
________________________________________
7️⃣ Summary
Every question a customer asks is an opportunity — not an obstacle.
Our goal is to ensure every doubt turns into a decision.
